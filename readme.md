Project was started for replacing our old job booking system. The intention was to handle all inventory, invoicing, bookings including an online customer portal. vehicle tracking etc through a new system.
Project was abandonded infavour of going to an off the shelf product which did close to everything we needed and the company was willing to work with our changes required.

Project was build on Laravel 5 and may contain security issues due to vulnerabilities in old versions discovered.

## Laravel PHP Framework
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
